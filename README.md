# Shipbattles
Offical ship battle rules & general description

Also if anyone wants to code feel free to do anything in the to be added soonish 


# Rules
you can access the following variables:
+ current energy
+ name variable(purely cosmetic)
+ anything with the final modifier




# How to play
add your own ship class that inherites from Ship.java

make whatever methods you want but if you start doing something that crashes the game or requires so much time the game is super glitchy you will be disqualified.

move method is called once per frame make sure it starts with super()



# Miscellaneous
## Current cost of actions
+ Scan - 2
+ Fire - 30
+ Thrust - 5

## Current balance issues
thrust seems to powerful + it makes it hard to do small manovers that would be cool

scan seems too expensive


## Future updates
### Uncomfirmed ideas
+ adding some sort of mines and making minefields
+ some sort of collision between ships
+ resizing map:ship ratio
+ adding forward directions so you have to rotate
+ customiziable ships so you can make a bigger ship with more health or something like that
+ shields
+ other abilities
+ missles/other weapons types that could have customizable ais too eg a bouncing shot that costs more energy per bounce
+ test the scanning code I don't trust it
+ decoys that trick scans
+ emp gun that makes scans return random numbers
+ chose approate frame rate
+ add free for alls with more then two ships

### To be added soonish
+ balance is heavily needed but idk how to fix this
+ bullet sprites


## Other
Oh by the way I will mark things that I, Steven, wish to do with :turtle:

I put a bunch of random ideas in uncomfirmed ideas some of which I actually like, feel free to ignore them and make your own 

Although I am not sure adding too much complexity is a good thing

Also I would like to create somewhat bigger group to promote more genralized strageties but idk if there really is anyone else who wants to play plus idk if you guys
want that.
